Title: Horiseon Website Challenge

Description:

The objective of this project was to refactor the Horiseon website and make it more accessible.

It's good practice to leave a project in a better state than it was met.

The problem that my project solves is that my web pages are more informative and that search engines find it easy to navigate through my website.

It was a challenging project. I received some help too from our instructor and also a learning assistant.

I enjoyed completing this project because I learned a lot of new technologies along the way.

This is the URL of my deployed page: https://cnwanneka.github.io/horiseon-website-challenge/
